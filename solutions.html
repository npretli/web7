		<h2>Final Solution: A Story Map Collection (ArcGIS Story Maps)</h2>
		<p>Try it out here:</p><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/8ae1a0c9f073480da9a3b96e3a8ba1a7">Kid-Friendly Neigbhourhoods in Toronto</a>

		    <h4>ArcGIS Story Collection Home Page</h4>
	    	    <p>The collection includes three items: a story map (Parents' Guide to Toronto Schools & Recreation), and two ArcGIS Dashboards to power the cartography that supports our story.</p>
		    <p>The home page provides easy access to all the items, and unlike ArcGIS Hub does not have additional clutter meant for other functionality (ie. a search bar). It's a simple and clean layout, with the 'Get Started' button prominently placed.</p>

		    <h4>Our ArcGIS Story Map's Heading:</h4>
		    <p>We added a story map to our collection to provide users with a quick tour of what they could expect to find in our dashboards, and potentially as a way to share any interesting patterns we saw in the data.</p>

		    <h4>Learning & Education ArcGIS Dashboard:</h4>
		    <p>The tabbed story map collection layout allows users to switch seamlessly from the introductory story map to the dashboards. The first dashboard allows parents to easily see schools and libraries in the current map view, against a background layer showing the percent of the population which is school-aged for each neighbourhood.</p>
		    <p>As the user pans and zooms around the map, the indicators and list to the left automatically filter to show only the libraries and schools in the current view, as well as which neigbhourhoods can currently be seen and their exact population percentages. The percentage number changes from orange to green if it goes above the city-wide average.</p>
		    <p>The map and list both also show the different schools types</p>

		<div class="col-6">
		    <h4>Outdoors & Sports ArcGIS Dashboard:</h4>
		    <p>Switching over to the activity-theme dashboard, we see a similar map with the same reference layer of school-aged children as a percent of population. The map shows some sports facilities for skating and swimming, as well as green spaces in Toronto. Once again filtering with pan and zoom, the user can explore different areas to see how many facilities and how much park area there is in the current view, with a list showing the largest parks currently visible.</p>
