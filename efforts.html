	    	<p>We rapidly established that we wanted to use ArcGIS Online as our platform of choice, and after consideration of our project's requirement to show not only a map but contextual data as well, settled on ArcGIS Dashboards as our preferred solution.</p>
	   	<p>Our vision involved being able to change active map layers and widget content dynamically based on the selection of a theme, but it turned out that Dashboards did not provide this ability. Widget interactions with maps are largely limited to filtering features in a layer, or (in the case of a list) highlighting specific items. Being unable to dynamically change the layer that a widget references also meant we would be unable to have more than one data theme displayed at a time in a single dashboard.</p>

	    <h3 class="top-align">Part 2: Grouping multiple dashboards</h3>
	    <p>After realizing that we would need to make separate dashboards for our education them & activity theme, we investigated ways to group those dashboards together. We started by focusing primarily on two options: ArcGIS Hub and Story Map Collections (the new version of Story Map Series).</p>

	    <h3 class="top-align">Interlude: Nested Dashboards</h3>
	    <p>While investigating those previous solutions, we also became aware of a third potential option which seemed highly promising thanks to the Esri Developer Conference, which had a presentation on nested dashboards. Nested dashboards can group multiple dashboards into a single master dashboard using embed widgets, and selections made in the master dashboard can be used to filter widgets in the child dashboards using URL parameters.</p>
	    <p>However, consultation with our advisor helped us realize that the Dashboards selection tool was inherently user-unfriendly, and rather than aim to populate widgets based on a single selection, we should aim to avoid selection altogether. So, we once again focused our efforts on ArcGIS Hub and Story Map Collections.</p>
